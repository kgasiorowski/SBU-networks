1a) Time spent to get to first router: $t = \frac{8Mb}{2Mb/s} =\boxed{4s}$\\	
Time spent in total: $4s * 3$ $links = \boxed{12s}$\\

1b) $\frac{1*10^4 bits}{2*10^6 bits/s} = \frac{1}{2*10^2} s = \boxed{0.005s}$\\
The second packet will be fully received at the first switch at time $t=$\fbox{$0.01s$}\\

1c) 
\begin{align*}
t &= \frac{(n+p+1)L}{R}\\
t &= \frac{(3+800+1) * 10^4 bits}{2*10^6 bits/s}\\
t &= \frac{8.04*10^6 bits}{2 * 10^6 bits/s}\\
t &= \boxed{4.02s}
\end{align*}
By utilizing message segmentation, the time taken to transmit the message is lowered by a factor of 3. This is because we are fully utilizing all links in the network as much as possible, instead of using one link at a time.\\

2a) $R = 2 * 10^6 bits/s$\\
$d_{prop} = \frac{2*10^7m}{2.5 * 10^8 m/s} = \frac{2}{25}s = \boxed{0.08s}$\\
\\
$R * d_{prop} = 0.08 * 2 * 10^6 = 0.16 * 10^6 = \boxed{1.6 * 10^5}$\\

2b) When the first packet is sent through the link, it spends 0.08 seconds in the link. During this 0.08 seconds, the link continues to accept bits at a rate equal to the bandwidth (2Mbps). So the total number of bits in the link is $0.08s * 2*10^6b/s =$ \fbox{$1.6 * 10^5 bits$}.\\

2c) The bandwidth-delay product is the maximum number of bits that can be in the link at any given time.\\
\\
2d)$w_{bit} = \frac{m}{R * d_{prop}} = \frac{2 * 10^7m}{1.6*10^5m/b} = \frac{200}{1.6} = \boxed{125m}$\\
If a bit is 125m wide, then a bit is a little more than twice as wide as a football field.\\
\\
2e) $w_{bit} = \frac{m}{R*d_{prop}} = \boxed{\frac{m}{R * \frac{m}{s}}}$\\

3)
\begin{align*}
F &= 1.5*10^{10} bits\\
u_s &= 3.0 * 10^7 bits/s\\
d_i &= 2.0 * 10^6 bits/s
\end{align*}

$N$, the number of users, is represented on the left hand side, has values of 10, 100, and 1000. $u$, the upload speed, has values of $3*10^5$, $7*10^5$, and $2*10^6$ and is represented on the bottom. All units in the table are seconds.
