CSE310 Programming HW #2

Name: Kuba Gasiorowski
ID: 109776237

Python version used: 3.5.2+

Usage: sudo python3 ping.py [hostname] [timeout in milliseconds] [number of pings]

If the hostname is left blank, it will default to "google.com".
The default timeout is 1,000ms (1s).
The default number of pings is 10.

The program intentionally sleeps between pings for one second, so as to make
output easier to read, and also not to flood the network with echo packets.

All of the checksum code was taken from piazza and most of the create_packet
function was also taken from piazza. The name for the function "verbose_ping"
was also taken from piazza.

The main function is wrapped in a try-catch so that even if the user interrupts
the program with ctrl-c it should still print statistics for whatever was completed
before exiting with grace.

The date field in each packet wasn't really used except for debugging purposes. Right
now it holds the time at which that specific packet was created.
